✅ 1. Basic SQL Syntax (Generic)
✅ INSERT
sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
✅ SELECT
sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
✅ UPDATE
sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2
WHERE condition;
✅ DELETE
sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
✅ 2. Practical‑Ready Example (Student Table)
Assume this table:

sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    city VARCHAR(50)
);
Now the queries:

✅ INSERT Example
sql
INSERT INTO student (name, age, city)
VALUES ('Rahul', 21, 'Jaipur');
✅ SELECT Examples
Select all rows:
sql
SELECT * FROM student;
Select specific columns:
sql
SELECT name, age FROM student;
Select with condition:
sql
SELECT * FROM student WHERE city = 'Jaipur';
✅ UPDATE Example
sql
UPDATE student
SET age = 22, city = 'Delhi'
WHERE id = 1;
✅ DELETE Example
sql
DELETE FROM student
WHERE id = 1
